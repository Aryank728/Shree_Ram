                        Ramayana is one of the two major sanskrit epics of ancient Bharat. The epic, traditionally
                        described to the Maharishi Valmiki, narrates the life of Rama, a legendary prince of Ayodhya city
                        in the kingdom of Kosala. The story follows his fourteen-year exile
                        to the forest urged by his father King Dasharatha, on the request of Rama's stepmother Kaikeyi;
                        his travels across forests in the Bharat's subcontinent with his wife Sita and brother
                        Lakshmana, the kidnapping of Sita by Ravana
                        – the king of Lanka, that resulted in war; and Rama's eventual return to Ayodhya to be crowned
                        king amidst jubilation and celebration.<br>Ramayana is one of the largest ancient epics in world
                        literature.
                        It consists of nearly 24,000 verses.

                                Rama is the main character of the tale. Portrayed as the seventh avatar of god Vishnu,
                                he is the eldest and favorite son of Dasharatha, the king of Ayodhya and his Chief
                                Queen, Kausalya. He is portrayed as the epitome of virtue. Dasharatha is forced by
                                Kaikeyi to command Rama to relinquish his right to the throne for fourteen years and go
                                into exile. Rama kills the evil demon Ravana, who abducted his wife Sita, and later
                                returns to Ayodhya to form an ideal state.

                                was collected in a pot and was buried in Earth, so she is called the daughter of

                                got a chance to marry her by breaking the Shiv Dhanush. Sita is portrayed as the epitome

                        <p>Rama is one of the most popular deities
                            worshipped in the Hindu religion. Each year, many devout pilgrims
                            trace their journey through India and Nepal, halting at each of the
                            holy sites along the way. The poem is not seen as just a literary
                            monument, but serves as an integral part of Hinduism and is held in
                            such reverence that the mere reading or hearing of it or certain
                            passages of it, is believed by Hindus to free them from sin and bless
                            the reader or listener. According to Hindu tradition, Rama is an incarnation (Avatar) of
                            god Vishnu. The main purpose of this incarnation is to demonstrate
                            the righteous path (dharma) for all living creatures on earth.
                        </p>

                        <p>The Ramayana was an important influence on later Sanskrit poetry and Hindu life and
                            culture. Its most
                            important moral influence was the importance of virtue, in the life of a citizen and in
                            the ideals of
                            the
                            formation of a state or of a functioning society. The basic teaching fo Ramayana is that
                            no matter how
                            powerful evil is, it will always be defeated by Good. Truth always wins, no matter how
                            vicious or
                            poisonous lie is because even a bitter truth oozes with positivity and the sweetest lie
                            has the darkest
                            agenda behind it. The win of good over evil is a universal fate.

                        <p>One of the most important literary works of ancient India, the
                            Ramayana has had a profound impact on art and culture in the
                            Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia with the lone exception of
                            Vietnam. The story ushered in the tradition of the next thousand
                            years of massive-scale works in the rich diction of regal courts and
                            Hindu temples. It has also inspired much secondary literature in
                            various languages, notably Kambaramayanam by Tamil poet
                            Kambar of the 12th century, Telugu language Molla Ramayanam by
                            poet Molla and Ranganatha Ramayanam by poet Gona Budda
                            Reddy, 14th century Kannada poet Narahari's Torave Ramayana and
                            15th century Bengali poet Krittibas Ojha's Krittivasi Ramayan, as
                            well as the 16th century Awadhi version, Ramacharitamanas, written
                            by Tulsidas.
                        </p>

                        <p>Ramayanic scenes have also been depicted through terracottas, stone sculptures, bronzes
                            and
                            paintings. These include the stone panel at Nagarjunakonda in Andhra Pradesh depicting
                            Bharata's
                            meeting with Rama at Chitrakuta (3rd century CE). The Ramayana became popular in
                            Southeast Asia during
                            8th century and was represented in literature, temple architecture, dance and theatre.
                            Today, dramatic
                            enactments of the story of the Ramayana, known as Ramlila, take place all across India
                            and in many
                            places across the globe within the Indian diaspora.

                        <h2 style="color: rgb(238, 23, 112);">History of Ram Mandir</h2>
                        <p>The Ayodhya Ram Mandir dispute has a complex and lengthy history, often linked to the
                            construction of the Babri Masjid in the 16th century by the Mughal emperor Babur. The
                            controversy surrounding the site has been a central point of contention for various
                            communities and groups over the course of 500 years.

                            In 1528, historical accounts suggest the construction of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. Over
                            the centuries, beliefs emerged among certain Hindu communities, claiming the presence of a
                            temple dedicated to Lord Rama beneath the mosque. This belief gained prominence,
                            contributing to the deep-rooted historical and emotional connections that various groups
                            developed with the site.

                            The conflict over the Ayodhya site escalated in the 20th century, leading to legal battles
                            and disputes over ownership. The culmination of this tension occurred in 1992 when a mob of
                            Hindu activists demolished the Babri Masjid, resulting in widespread communal riots and
                            tensions.

                            The narrative of a 500-year struggle underscores the enduring nature of the dispute, with
                            each passing century contributing to the layers of historical and cultural significance
                            attached to the site. The legal and political battles, coupled with social and communal
                            tensions surrounding the Ayodhya dispute, have spanned a significant period, characterizing
                            it as a prolonged struggle.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The resolution of the dispute came in 2019 with the Supreme Court of India delivering a
                            landmark verdict. The court ruled in favor of the construction of the Ram Mandir on the
                            entire disputed land, while also directing the government to allocate an alternative piece
                            of land for the construction of a mosque. This verdict marked a significant milestone in the
                            history of the contentious Ayodhya issue, providing a legal resolution to a dispute that had
                            persisted for centuries.

                            The Ayodhya Ram Mandir dispute has not only been a legal and political matter but has also
                            had profound social and cultural implications. The story has been deeply ingrained in the
                            collective consciousness of the Indian people, influencing art, literature, and religious
                            practices. Various literary works, such as the Ramayana, have played a crucial role in
                            shaping the narrative surrounding the Ayodhya site, contributing to its cultural
                            significance.

                            Furthermore, the dispute has influenced artistic expressions, with Ramayanic scenes depicted
                            through terracottas, stone sculptures, bronzes, and paintings. The popularity of the
                            Ramayana in Southeast Asia during the 8th century attests to its widespread cultural impact
                            beyond the Indian subcontinent.

                            Today, dramatic enactments of the Ramayana story, known as Ramlila, take place across India
                            and in many places globally within the Indian diaspora. These performances, along with
                            various artistic representations, continue to keep the cultural and religious significance
                            of the Ayodhya site alive.

                    matters, the court decided to separate the land, potentially delineating areas linked to the mosque
                    and Lord Ram's birthplace. This decision aimed at resolving the land-related tensions between the
                    communities, emphasizing legal principles over religious sentiments. The Babri Masjid and Ram
                    Janmabhoomi conflicts, deeply rooted over centuries, were significantly shaped by these colonial-era
                    legal actions, leaving a lasting impact on Ayodhya's socio-political dynamics and India as a whole.
